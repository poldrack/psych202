# Psych 202: Graduate Seminar in Cognitive Neuroscience

## Overview

Cognitive neuroscience is a very broad field; instead of giving a broad overview of all possible findings, we will focus on exemplary findings from each domain, with the goal of understanding the kinds of questions that we can and cannot successfully ask using cognitive neuroscience methods. In addition to discussing the main content areas of cognitive neuroscience, we will address cross-cutting issues related to the use of cognitive neuroscience to address various types of broader questions.

## Course Structure

This course will primarily involve discussion and hands-on exercises. For each class session, there will be assigned readings and/or videos, which you will be responsible for reading/watching prior to the class session. Most class sessions will involve two primary readings: one theory/conceptual piece, and one empirical piece. I will sometimes provide pointers to particular parts of readings to focus on, especially if they are longer. You should arrive ready to discuss each of the materials in depth if called upon. (Note: Some readings are only accessible from the campus network, or using the Stanford VPN)

### Student presentations of conceptual papers

Each theory/conceptual piece will be presented by a student (or group of students, depending on the class size).  These students will be expected to give a short presentation outlining the key ideas of the paper. The presentation should last no more than 15 minutes, in order to allow sufficient time for discussion; this means that the paper often cannot be presented in full detail.

### Instructor-led discussion of empirical papers

Each empirical paper will have two student discussants assigned. These students must each submit a review of the paper at least one day beforehand, in the style of a journal peer review.  Examples are provided in the Files section.   During class, the instructor will lead discussion of the paper and ask the discussants to answer questions and explain the paper.  

### Collaborative note-taking by student scribes

For each class session there will be two assigned scribes who will to take collaborative notes on the presentations and discussion in a Google Doc, which will be made available to the class.

### Post-class discussion questions

Students will be assigned a post-class discussion question for each session, due the following day via Canvas.  The collaborative notes taken by the scribes can be used to help in writing the response. These can only be submitted by students who were present in class; All students get 3 free drops to accommodate travel or illness.

### Final project

The major assignment of the course will be a final paper, which will require proposing an experiment to address a specific question in cognitive neuroscience.  A brief proposal is due on 10/5, and a full first draft is due on 11/16. Each of you will be assigned papers from two other students to perform peer reviews; these peer reviews will be due 11/30. The final draft of your paper (including a formal response to the peer reviews) will be due 12/6.

## Grading

Grading will be determined as follows:

- 10%: Participation as discussant (including peer review)
- 10%: Partcipation as scribe
- 30%: Post-class discussion questions
- 5%: Paper proposal
- 15%: First draft of final paper
- 10%: Peer review of final papers
- 20%: Final draft of final paper

## Students with Documented Disabilities

Students who may need an academic accommodation based on the impact of a disability must initiate the request with the Office of Accessible Education (OAE). Professional staff will evaluate the request with required documentation, recommend reasonable accommodations, and prepare an Accommodation Letter for faculty dated in the current quarter in which the request is being made. Students should contact the OAE as soon as possible since timely notice is needed to coordinate accommodations. The OAE is located at 563 Salvatierra Walk (phone: 723-1066, URL: http://studentaffairs.stanford.edu/oae).

## Honor Code

You are expected to uphold the Stanford Honor Code (https://studentaffairs.stanford.edu/communitystandards/policy/honor-code). Scholastic dishonesty, which includes any kind of cheating or plagiarism, will not be tolerated. Plagiarism is the presentation of someone else's work or ideas as your own, and applies both to word-for-word copying and to paraphrasing or repetition of the original thoughts of another without attribution ("patch-writing"). You must not use any AI systems such as ChatGPT to create any of your written submissions.
